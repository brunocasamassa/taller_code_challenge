        This is a project for Taller Technologies as part of techincal interview.

COMPOSE + HILT + MVVM + CLEAN ARCH + UNIT TESTS

it goes through a UI Layer using compose and it combines the best practices i have by using MVVM + Clean architeture,
making sure each layer has their own responsability and well-coded data communication between them.
It also has a DI layer which provides reusable instances for the same class, providing a better performance. They are all depending of abstractions instead of implementations for their params, that way we have a better decoupling of instances which makes easier for future features implementations + for testing.  

* I also created a DAO so the UI layer can look directly to the persisted database instead of doing another "api call" 

* I tried to use a typealias as you well explained at the interview, good point! 

* ui.theme folder was generated by default by Android Studio, injust reused it.


****TESTS********
JUNit + Mockk
the reason for mockk is because it has a simpler way to mock multiple instances, 
no need to map every layer the mocked instance goes through for mocking it(dataSource, apis , etc). 


Reach me out at anytime for any question/suggestion about any approach i did.
